# PRODIGY_CS_01 – Caesar Cipher

## Project Description
This project implements the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique used in cryptography.
It encrypts and decrypts text by shifting characters by a fixed key value.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3

## How It Works
- Takes user input text
- Applies character shifting based on a key
- Supports encryption and decryption

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Arjunyadav7976/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
2. Go to the project folder:
   cd PRODIGY_CS_01
3. Run the program:
   python caesar_cipher.py
